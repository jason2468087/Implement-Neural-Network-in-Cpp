# KineticNeuralNetwork

## Introduction
This is a Kinetic Neural Network built from scratch in C++. Not only function properly, it was also well optimized to minimize training time. The network is able to read both CSV and common image file as input. You can tweak the parameters to adjust input/output size or training performance.
